1. IC (integrated circuit),An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit  is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip")
of semiconductor material, usually silicon.Large numbers of tiny MOSFETs integrate into a small chip.
2. To design an IC we need to develop a code(programe),for this code we use verilog language which is HDL(Hard Description Language).
3. This IC are build with transistors in it with the gates too,we use the gates in verilog logics codes 
4. lets use design a Hafe Adder circuit  
                            ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93262817/147666166-c30646a2-cc2b-401e-9438-b4e3d1bfa64e.png)
5. In this image (or code) we first write module which is keyword and and next in side the bracets we write all inputs and outputs which is called port list,
    next we write all i/p and o/p and then the gates which are used in the ic and then endmodule
6. we also write testbench for it which is written to verify wether the dsign is perfectly working or not
